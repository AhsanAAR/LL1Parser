# LL1 Parser driver

We use a basic LL1 parsing algorithm using input and symbol stack to parse a code input, to check if it if syntactically correct or not according to a given grammar. The grammar and its corresponding parse table (can be generate by [](https://github.com/AhsanAAR/LL1ParseTableGenerator)) is provided. The input code is also given in the form of a token stream that can be generated by a lexical analyzer (lex is a renowned library). 

The sample input code provided in this repo is valid and can be seen in the `accepted_code.txt` file. The corresponding tokens are in `accepted_tokens.txt`.
